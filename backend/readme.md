# Node-Express Backend Template

I've built backends from scratch for a few small projects and had to go back over notes on how I'd done it previously. Which is all fine and good, that's antithetical to coding! We code to eliminate redundant work.

So this is a pretty bare bones Node.js-Express.js backend that need some extra love to make it an app.

Procfile included for Heroku deployment.

## How to get started

4.  Create routes files.

## Starting Server
1. In the terminal: from `backend` folder, type `npm start`.
