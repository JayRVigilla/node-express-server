## Node-Express Backend Template

I've built backends from scratch for a few small projects and had to go back over notes on how I'd done it previously. Which is all fine and good, that's antithetical to coding! We code to eliminate redundant work.

So this is a pretty bare bones Node.js-Express.js backend that need some extra love to make it an app.

1.  Clone this repository and `cd` into it
2.  Create your routes files.
3.  `psql < schema.sql`
4.  `npm install`
5.  `nodemon`
